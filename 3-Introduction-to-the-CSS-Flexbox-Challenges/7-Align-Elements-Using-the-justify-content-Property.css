<!-- justify-content is a property used in CSS that allows 
for the flex container to place the contents within in a specific order.

justify-content can be defined as follows: 
flex-start: aligns items to the start of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the items to the left of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the top of the container.
flex-end: aligns items to the end of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the items to the right of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the bottom of the container.
space-between: aligns items to the center of the main axis, with extra space placed between the items. The first and last items are pushed to the very edge of the flex container. For example, in a row the first item is against the left side of the container, the last item is against the right side of the container, then the other items between them are spaced evenly.
space-around: similar to space-between but the first and last items are not locked to the edges of the container, the space is distributed around all the items
