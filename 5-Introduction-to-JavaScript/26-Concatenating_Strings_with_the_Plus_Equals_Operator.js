// String concatenation in JS can also be done with the += operator. This operator informs JS to take the existing variable on the left and concatenate it with the string on the right. 

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";

myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
