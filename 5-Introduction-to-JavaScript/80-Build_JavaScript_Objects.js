// In this example, we built our myDog object to contain several properties of a dog. It contains "name", "legs", "tails", and "friends" properties and are stored in key value pairs.
// Objects are similar to arrays in that they store several data sets but are accessed differently. In JS we would access object properties like so, myDog.friends[0].

// Example
var ourDog = {
    "name": "Camper",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["everything!"]
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line.
  
  var myDog = {
    "name": "Spike",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["Fluffy", "Simba"]
  };
