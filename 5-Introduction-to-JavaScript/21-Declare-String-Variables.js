// Strings are a series of zero or more characters enclosed within a pair of single quotes or double quotes.
// "Oscar" would be classified as a string literal because the value is fixed. Any changes to this string would be an entirely new string.
// In contrast, a variable is a symbol that can take on a variety of data types. 

// Example
var firstName = "Alan";
var lastName = "Turing";

// Only change code below this line
var myFirstName = "Oscar";
var myLastName = "Orchilles";
