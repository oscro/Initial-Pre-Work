// Variables hold information or data in the form of a pointer. 
// In the example below we are declaring two variables 
// but they are not yet pointing to any form of data.
// Variables in JavaScript can point to a variety of data types 
// such as Numbers, Boolean, Strings, and Objects.

// Example
var ourName;

// Declare myName below this line
var myName;
