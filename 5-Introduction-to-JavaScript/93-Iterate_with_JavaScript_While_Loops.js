// A while loop will continue executing the block of code until the condition returns false. It can be thought of as - while this is true, do this.

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 0;
// Only change code below this line.
while (myArray.length !== 5) {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
  console.log(myArray);
}
