// To get the last character of a string, it would be most efficient to use the .length property of the string and subtract 1.
// We subtract one from the length because counting begins at index 0.

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
