// It is important to keep your code succinct. In the case below, we initially wrote if/else statements to return true or false based on the condition.
// The most efficient way of writing this code is to use the equality operator since it returns true or false. 

function isLess(a, b) {
    // Fix this code
   return a < b; 
  }
  
  // Change these values to test
  isLess(10, 15);
