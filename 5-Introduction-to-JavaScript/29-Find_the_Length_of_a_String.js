// Strings in JS have a length property that gives the amount of characters in a string. It can be accessed using dot notation after the variable name containing the string or after the string literal.

// Example
var firstNameLength = 0;
var firstName = "Ada";

firstNameLength = firstName.length;

// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
