// In this example, we used a do while loop which always executes the code block at least once even if the condition is false. 
// While loops check the condition and then execute the code block based on the condition. 

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.

do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5)
